EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Masters in social work has prepared me to understand various issues which are the main concerns in today’s world. My two years of field work experience during my masters in the areas like psychiatric, school counselling and working with special groups have given me a chance to understand and build a perspective regarding different kinds of problems and issues faced by them and how as a social worker, we need to broaden our perception and be more result oriented. Most of my experiences have been in the counselling setup but along with that I am equally equipped to work in the areas of research, project proposals and advocacy. My aim is to work for a change; one which will be a positive change in the society.
